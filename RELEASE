This file contains notes for the little b source code.  If you are
interested in getting started right away with using little b to build
models, it may be easier to download the GUI application from the 
little b website: http://littleb.org/download.html.

Little b is a Lisp-based language designed to allow the user to 
build models from shared libraries.  It was written and designed by 
Aneil Mallavarapu at the Harvard Medical School Department of Systems 
Biology in Boston.  

Libraries have been developed for building ODE models of molecular networks 
in multi-compartment systems such as cellular epithelia.  As of version 1.5
it includes a graph-based method for representing molecular complexes.

The language contains mechanisms for rule-based reasoning, symbolic mathematics 
and object-oriented definitions. The syntax is designed to be terse and 
human-readable to facilitate communication. Since little b is based in Lisp,
the environment is both interactive and compilable.

The source code works on Windows XP and Linux.  Mac OS support is under 
development.  Little b runs on these ANSI Common Lisp implementations:

  * Lispworks 4.x and 5.x, commercial Lisp IDE w/ in line debugger
        - little b does not run on the Free Personal Edition 
                    because of memory restrictions
  * Allegro 8.x, another high quality, fast CL implementation
  * CLisp 2.39+, free, open source GPL-licensed Common Lisp 
          (I recommend using it with Emacs and SLIME)
	
Others may work too.  We'd be happy to hear about it.

To run the source code, you'll need a Lisp interpreter, and an editor.  Any 
of the above will do.  If you use CLisp, you should consider using Emacs 
with SLIME, an editor mode that provides a Lisp command line and syntax
highlighting.

Changes:
1.5.5 (2007-11-29)
==================
Thanks to German Enciso for his help finding these bugs.

<< User-visible changes >>

* Bug Fixes
  + every instance now being asserted into database correctly (kb-run fix)
	+ reaction-generated complex-species-type are now properly canonicalized
	+ examples/example5 -complexes truncation error addressed

<< Internal Changes >>

* Added Files:
  + make-release.sh (creates source file release archives) 
  + compile-all.lisp (ensures little b and library fasls are produced)

Changes:
1.5.4 (2007-11-20)
=================

Many thanks to Carlos Lopez for providing the impetus for getting things working with CLisp, and his work in discovering numerous bugs and problems.

<< User-visible changes >>

* New functionality:
  + Complexes now work in multiple locations
  + Added the notion of dimensionality 

* File changes:
  + b-user/non-dimensional-ode-biochemistry is deprecated (warning is issued)
    include b-user/ode-biochem instead
  + b-user/3d-ode-biochemistry is deprecated 
    include b-user/3d-ode-biochem instead

* Portability:
  + Support for CLISP 2.42
    - little b now loads, compiles and provides a working compile-library function 
      on CLISP (tested on Linux & Windows XP)
	
* Numerous bug fixes

<< Internal changes >>

* New Functionality:
  + ASDF+ includes DELETE-BINARIES, which deletes the binaries files 
    (not directories of an ASDF system)  
    USAGE: (DELETE-BINARIES system-name)

* Source tree
  + Moved platform specific code to the platform directory, 
    - removed editor-lispworks.lisp from utility dir
    - now lispworks.lisp and clisp.lisp in platform dir

* Compliance
  + Placement of LOOP UNTIL/WHEN keywords now fixed for CLISP
    (always appear after FOR now)
  + DECLARE IGNORE directives added all over

* Bug Fixes
  + fixed reader functions work with CLISP

* Misc Changes
  + introduced +top-level-pprint-dispatch+ (needed for correct printing in CLisp)
    - a bug in CLisp 2.42 pprint-logical-block causes the pprint-dispatch table
      to be ignored.  Reported & fixed; Will be in Clisp 2.44 release.
