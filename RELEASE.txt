This file contains notes for the little b source code, version 1-5-6.  If 
you are interested in getting started right away with using little b to 
build models, it may be easier to download the GUI application from the 
little b website: http://littleb.org/download.html.

Little b is a Lisp-based language designed to allow the user to 
build models from shared libraries.  It was written and designed by 
Aneil Mallavarapu at the Harvard Medical School Department of Systems 
Biology in Boston.  

Libraries have been developed for building ODE models of molecular networks 
in multi-compartment systems such as cellular epithelia.  As of version 1.5
it includes a graph-based method for representing molecular complexes.

The language contains mechanisms for rule-based reasoning, symbolic mathematics 
and object-oriented definitions. The syntax is designed to be terse and 
human-readable to facilitate communication. Since little b is based in Lisp,
the environment is both interactive and compilable.

The source code works on Windows XP and Linux.  Mac OS support is under 
development.  Little b runs on these ANSI Common Lisp implementations:

  * Lispworks 4.x and 5.x, commercial Lisp IDE w/ in line debugger
        - little b does not run on the Free Personal Edition 
                    because of memory restrictions
  * Allegro 8.x, another high quality, fast CL implementation
  * CLisp 2.39+, free, open source GPL-licensed Common Lisp 
          (Works with Emacs and SLIME)
	
Others may work too.  We'd be happy to hear about it.

To run the source code, you'll need a Lisp interpreter, and an editor.  Any 
of the above will do.  If you use CLisp, you should consider using Emacs 
with SLIME, an editor mode that provides a Lisp command line and syntax
highlighting.

Changes:
1.5.6 (2007-12-23)
==================
Bugs discovered by German Enciso and Carlos Lopez in the graph-based reaction
inference code have been fixed in this release.  Thanks also to Albert Krewinkel 
who has started working on SBCL compliance.  Some of his changes and fixes for 
several bugs he found appear in this release.  

<< Known Issues >>

* Will not load on SBCL
* CLISP printing is a mess.   Object forms (lists beginning with OBJECT) should 
  print as [], but print as (OBJECT ..) when inside a pprint-logical-block.
  Same for FLD forms and MATH forms.

  This due to a bug which is fixed in CLISP CVS source tree (but not yet
  released):
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=101355&aid=1835520&group_id=1355
  We may post a prerelease build on the little b SourceForge site.  However, even this
  version has pretty-print formatting issues (too many line feeds).
  !! Need to figure develop a simple test case and submit CLISP bug report !!

<< User-visible changes >>

Bug Fixes
* Bugs causing complexes to be computed incorrectly during rxn inference now fixed.
* explicitly provided locations in reaction-types and complex-reaction-types are now
  handled correctly.  E.g., {x @ :outer @ membrane ->> x @ :inner}
* Changed get-cvs-... scripts and README.txt to reflect correct CVS repository for graph-tools
* CLISP package lock problem fixed
* CLISP bug prevents load (workaround provided in this release):
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1854698&group_id=1355&atid=101355
* reversible-reaction now constructs properly
* littleb.lisp now automatically compiles b library when /src files have changed


Features
* Added datatable macros (with-substitution-table with-data-table, etc), exported from b package
  - allow the user to specify a body of code which will be duplicated 
    for each set of substitutions provided
* Errors now do not dump user into the debugger.  To enable the debugger,
  (setf *debugger-enabled* t) at the command prompt or your init.lisp file.
* sites definitions now accept an optional :documentation keyword argument
  e.g.,	(defmonomer egf (L :documentation "ligand binding site"))
* SLIME environments now open in B-USER
* Double asterisks, **, can now be used to indicate that the rest of the sites 
  accept any state/binding: eg, [[receptor 1 **][ligand 1]]
* Field access on NIL produces a more user-friendly message now 
  (cryptic "Attempt to access NULL.X, :X is not a field of NULL" errors are replaced)
* printing a bit fixed
* (DESCRIBE concept) now works

<< Internal Changes >>

Modifications
* Started move toward SBCL Compliance (AK)
* Removed useless :source-extension line which only seems to cause problems with and clisp, sbcl
* Got rid of check-complex-species-type-graph check inside complex-species-type-ctor
* Added comments explaining +b-standard-tokens-readtable+ and *working-readtable*
* Removed useless objectify fn
* added .vars, .length fields to lists and all other objects
* exporting some additional fieldinfo accessors to b package
* print-math-form now breaks lines before & after operators
* Removed mop.lisp (AK) - all functionality in clos.lisp
* Added .as-list field to sum-expression objects
* fixes to global-value - symbols now deleted correctly
* #| reader no longer returns a value (NIL).
* site-label-value changed to site-label-state
* get-cvs-modules scripts now cvs export lisa rather than checkout 
   (before this, cvs tag failed because no lisa write access)

Bug fixes
* Got rid of circular include dependency in complex/species-type
* library-needs-compile-p fixed
* compilation bug fixed in def-with-fields
* added defstruct-with-fields, defclass-with-fields
* *print-pretty* set to nil when dynamic rules are added

Changes:
1.5.5 (2007-11-29)
==================
Thanks to German Enciso for his help finding these bugs.

<< User-visible changes >>

* Bug Fixes
  + every instance now being asserted into database correctly (kb-run fix)
	+ reaction-generated complex-species-type are now properly canonicalized
	+ examples/example5 -complexes truncation error addressed

<< Internal Changes >>

* Added Files:
  + make-release.sh (creates source file release archives) 
  + compile-all.lisp (ensures little b and library fasls are produced)

Changes:
1.5.4 (2007-11-20)
=================

Many thanks to Carlos Lopez for providing the impetus for getting things working with CLisp, and his work in discovering numerous bugs and problems.

<< User-visible changes >>

* New functionality:
  + Complexes now work in multiple locations
  + Added the notion of dimensionality 

* File changes:
  + b-user/non-dimensional-ode-biochemistry is deprecated (warning is issued)
    include b-user/ode-biochem instead
  + b-user/3d-ode-biochemistry is deprecated 
    include b-user/3d-ode-biochem instead

* Portability:
  + Support for CLISP 2.42
    - little b now loads, compiles and provides a working compile-library function 
      on CLISP (tested on Linux & Windows XP)
	
* Numerous bug fixes

<< Internal changes >>

* New Functionality:
  + ASDF+ includes DELETE-BINARIES, which deletes the binaries files 
    (not directories of an ASDF system)  
    USAGE: (DELETE-BINARIES system-name)

* Source tree
  + Moved platform specific code to the platform directory, 
    - removed editor-lispworks.lisp from utility dir
    - now lispworks.lisp and clisp.lisp in platform dir

* Compliance
  + Placement of LOOP UNTIL/WHEN keywords now fixed for CLISP
    (always appear after FOR now)
  + DECLARE IGNORE directives added all over

* Bug Fixes
  + fixed reader functions work with CLISP

* Misc Changes
  + introduced +top-level-pprint-dispatch+ (needed for correct printing in CLisp)
    - a bug in CLisp 2.42 pprint-logical-block causes the pprint-dispatch table
      to be ignored.  Reported & fixed; Will be in Clisp 2.44 release.
